# HTML5 BOTW Master Savegame editor
Modification of Marc's BOTW Master Save Editor that calculates scaling score for a Breath of the Wild savegame.

Reddit user [leoletino](https://www.reddit.com/user/leoetlino/) reverse engineered the game
and discovered how does the game difficulty and loot quality scale, which is by number of
certain enemies defeated. This info is stored in the savegame file and can be parsed to
calculate the current scaling score, which can be later compared to the corresponding
[enemies and weapon quality tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRSlyOD7FLAn1TUBn64Pu8Pld-WOfgcVByuywHMWvBTEV0j8potD1wkBs-MJJXf-gvEkpfItUCMqMk6/pubhtml#)
